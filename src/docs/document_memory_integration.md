# Document Memory Integration

This document describes the memory integration capabilities added to the Document Analysis Agent, enabling contextual understanding across the mortgage application process.

## Overview

The Document Memory Integration enhances the Document Analysis Agent with memory capabilities that allow it to:

1. **Store and retrieve document analysis results** across sessions
2. **Track document verification history** throughout the application process
3. **Detect inconsistencies** between documents and store them for future reference
4. **Perform semantic searches** across document content
5. **Maintain relationships** between different documents
6. **Generate consolidated summaries** of all document information

These memory capabilities ensure that the agent can maintain context throughout the mortgage application process, improving decision-making accuracy and creating a more coherent experience.

## Architecture

The memory integration consists of two key components:

1. **DocumentMemoryManager**: A dedicated class that handles all memory operations related to document analysis, providing specialized methods for document-specific memory needs.

2. **Enhanced DocumentAnalysisAgent**: The existing Document Analysis Agent updated with memory capabilities, allowing it to store and retrieve context while processing documents.

## Key Features

### Document Context Storage

Documents are stored in context with rich metadata, enabling:

- Tracking of document processing history
- Version control for updated documents
- Metadata retrieval for application processing

```python
# Example: Store document analysis in memory
await memory_manager.store_document_analysis(
    application_id="APP-12345",
    document_id="DOC-67890",
    document_type="INCOME_VERIFICATION",
    analysis_results=analysis_result
)
```

### Semantic Search

The integration enables semantic search across document content:

- Find documents by conceptual similarity, not just keyword matching
- Locate specific information across multiple documents
- Retrieve semantically relevant document sections

```python
# Example: Search for semantically similar documents
similar_documents = await memory_manager.search_similar_documents(
    application_id="APP-12345",
    query_text="borrower's previous employment history",
    limit=5
)
```

### Document Relationship Tracking

The system maintains relationships between documents:

- Track which documents support or contradict each other
- Understand connections between related documents
- Build a knowledge graph of application documentation

```python
# Example: Store relationships between documents
await memory_manager.store_document_relationships(
    application_id="APP-12345",
    relationships=[
        {
            "source_id": "DOC-67890",
            "target_id": "DOC-67891",
            "type": "confirms",
            "description": "Pay stub confirms employment stated in application"
        }
    ]
)
```

### Verification History

Each document's verification activities are tracked:

- Record automated and manual verification steps
- Track confidence scores over time
- Maintain an audit trail of document processing

```python
# Example: Store verification record
await memory_manager.store_document_verification_history(
    application_id="APP-12345",
    document_id="DOC-67890",
    verification_record={
        "verification_type": "automated_analysis",
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "status": "PROCESSED",
        "has_inconsistencies": False
    }
)
```

### Inconsistency Detection

The system detects and stores inconsistencies between documents:

- Track conflicting information across documents
- Flag potential fraud indicators
- Maintain history of resolved inconsistencies

```python
# Example: Retrieve document inconsistencies
memory = await document_agent.retrieve_document_memory(
    application_id="APP-12345",
    memory_type="inconsistencies"
)
```

## Integration with Semantic Kernel

This memory integration leverages Semantic Kernel's memory capabilities:

- Uses the MemoryManager for context storage and retrieval
- Employs semantic memory for similarity-based document search
- Maintains structured context for document processing

## Usage Examples

See the `document_memory_usage_example.py` file for a complete workflow example demonstrating the use of document memory capabilities in a mortgage lending application.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the memory integration include:

1. **Memory-aware document summarization**: Generating summaries that incorporate historical context
2. **Time-based memory retrieval**: Retrieving documents based on temporal relationships
3. **Cross-application document connections**: Finding similar documents across different applications
4. **Proactive inconsistency detection**: Using memory to anticipate potential inconsistencies in new documents
5. **Memory-enhanced reasoning**: Using document history to improve the accuracy of reasoning agents
